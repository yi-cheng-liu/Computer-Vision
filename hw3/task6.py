    of having a bug where your homography estimation and warping code have odd
    interactions.

    Be careful about:
    a) The final image size 
    b) Writing code so that you first estimate H and then merge images with H.
    The system can fail to work due to either failing to find the homography or
    failing to merge things correctly.

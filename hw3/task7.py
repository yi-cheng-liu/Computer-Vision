    '''
    You may want to write a function that merges the two images together given
    the two images and a homography: once you have the homography you do not
    need the correspondences; you just need the homography.
    Writing a function like this is entirely optional, but may reduce the chance
    of having a bug where your homography estimation and warping code have odd
    interactions.
    
    Input - img1: Input image 1 of shape (H1,W1,3)
            img2: Input image 2 of shape (H2,W2,3)
            H: homography mapping betwen them
    Output - V: stitched image of size (?,?,3); unknown since it depends on H
                but make sure in V, for pixels covered by both img1 and warped img2,
                you see only img2

def improve_image(scene, template, transfer):

    Detect template image in the scene image and replace it with transfer image.

    Input - scene: image (H,W,3)
            template: image (K,K,3)
            transfer: image (L,L,3)
    Output - augment: the image with 
    
    Hints:
    a) You may assume that the template and transfer are both squares.
    b) This will work better if you find a nearest neighbor for every template
       keypoint as opposed to the opposite, but be careful about directions of the
       estimated homography and warping!
